	<h1>About Hilary Y. Aguirre</h1>
	<p>This is the homepage [still under construction] for Hilary Aguirre.</p>
<p>As a statistician and data scientist, I love finding patterns and meaning in data.  I love finding connections, especially between seemingly disparate subjects.  After teaching high school math for 10 years, I am now eager to apply statistics to learn more about the world.  Cryptography and number theory? Political science? The speeches of Cicero in the original Latin? Stats apply to all of these!</p>
<p>Can you spot the actual camels in this photo from National Geographic? Great for discussion of transformations or projections. The teacher in me is always spotting applications of math and statistics in the real world, and thinking of how those might be useful in the classroom...</p>
