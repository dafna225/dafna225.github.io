	<h2>The data science blog of Hilary Aguirre.</h2>

	<p>I am a data scientist in Los Angeles who holds advanced degrees in Statistics and Education. I love finding patterns and meaning in data and discovering connections, especially between seemingly disparate subjects. Below are some thoughts, discoveries, and favorite plots as I experiment with techniques in stats, machine learning, and data visualization.</a></p>

<h1>A Picture and a Thousand Words</h1>
<p>This is the homepage [still under construction] for Hilary Aguirre.</p>
<p>As a statistician and data scientist, I love finding patterns and meaning in data.  I love finding connections, especially between seemingly disparate subjects.  After teaching high school math for 10 years, I am now eager to apply statistics to learn more about the world.  Cryptography and number theory? Political science? The speeches of Cicero in the original Latin? Stats apply to all of these!</p>
